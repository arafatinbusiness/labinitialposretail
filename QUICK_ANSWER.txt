# DIRECT ANSWER: Upload to Vercel

## RECOMMENDATION: Direct Upload to Vercel

**Choose: DIRECT UPLOAD TO VERCEL**

### Why Direct Upload is Better for You:
1. **Faster** - No GitHub middle step
2. **Simpler** - Just drag and drop
3. **Your project is already configured** with `vercel.json`
4. **No version control needed** if you just want hosting

### Steps for Direct Upload:
1. **Build your project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates `dist/` folder

2. **Zip the `dist/` folder contents** (not the folder itself)

3. **Go to Vercel.com → New Project → Drag & drop zip**

4. **Configure as Vite project** (auto-detected)

5. **Deploy** - Done in 2 minutes

### When to Use GitHub + Vercel:
- If you want **automatic deployments** on every git push
- If you need **version history** and collaboration
- If you want **preview deployments** for each PR

### For Your Case: Direct Upload is Perfect
Your app is ready. Just build and upload the `dist/` folder.

### Quick Command:
```bash
# Build
npm run build

# Create zip of dist contents
cd dist
zip -r ../labinitial-app.zip .
cd ..

# Upload labinitial-app.zip to Vercel
```
